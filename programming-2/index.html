				<h1>Echo's Programming 2 Portfolio</h1>
				<h2>Programming 2 - Fall 2024</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to my Programming 2 Portfolio! 
					Here you can find some examples of what programs I made during the fall 2024 semester. 
					I used C# for every program, though I also know Python. 
					Next semester, I am looking forward to learning C++! 
					I hope you enjoy!

						In this simulation, the player acts as a manager of the Bracken Cave, a cave famous for its hundreds of bats. 
						The player must keep all populations happy as you try to earn enough money to survive. 
						Animals and plants can all interact with each other in a wide variety of ways. 
						You can buy items from the Vendor to help keep certain populations at bay. 
						Tourists become happy from low prices, but you need money or else you will go bankrupt. 
						If tourists are happy, then you will get more money, but the bats may be scared away. 
						The player needs to be careful in their decisions in order to survive as long as possible!

						in the word but in a different spot, or not in the word. 
						This game uses a large range of popular 5 letter words, so there are no uncommon words to be found!

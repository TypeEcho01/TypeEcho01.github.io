						We created Echo: Cloning Industries because we wanted to pioneer the field of
						cloning. It is an honor to have developed the first cloning technology, the Echo
						Replicator. The Echo Replicator may be the first of its kind, but we believe it has
						already been nearly perfected from over a decade of testing various prototypes. The
						Echo replicator perfectly replicates someone's likeness and brain structure in just
						under an hour! We call the resulting clone an Echo. No matter the health of the
						replicated person, the Echo will be perfectly healthy. This technology is the
						crowning achievement of our company, and we are looking to expand our
						technology to a wider range of applications, such as working on non-organic things.
						We hope you stick around to see what we have in store as the pioneers of the future!
					</p>

						Echo: Cloning Industries was founded in 2018 by Dr. Joe Oak. 
						Dr. Oak is a driven visionary ready to change the world. 
						Based in Chicago, Dr. Oak has himself cloned over 1,000 people and counting! 
						He has a strong passion for his work and goal of improving life for all. 
						There is no doubt that Dr. Oak was the perfect man for the job of bringing 
						cloning to the public, and his continued hands-on approach speaks to 
						his devotion to his craft.

						Want to be today's pioneer for tomorrow's
						reality? Come to any of our facilities and ask about internships! You'll learn more
						about our clones and get a close-up view of how our team operates! You may even
						be invited for a job where you'd operate our Echo Replicators or help come up with
						new ideas and designs.

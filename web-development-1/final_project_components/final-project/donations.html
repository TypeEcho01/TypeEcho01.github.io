						Will you choose to be in the small percent that donates? 
						According to our statistics, less than 3% of users donate to us. 
						Donations help us continue to do research and develop new technologies. 
						Please, if you have the time, consider donating even just a small amount.

						Wondering what we do with your donations? 
						We split it between doing more research on clones and how they work, 
						as well as making new iterations of our cloning technology. 
						With each donation, cloning gets cheaper and more accessable. 
						Consider it not just a donation to us, but also to the future!

							The first Echo, which was a clone of the founder Dr. Joe
							Oak, was cloned in 2006, a little over a decade before the opening of this technology
							to the public. At the time, the name of the company was not yet considered, so we
							dubbed this first clone "Echo", since it was an echo of Dr. Oak. Echo was full of life
							and ecstatic to be alive, just as excited as Dr. Oak that it was a success.
							Unfortunately, since this was the first prototype of our technology, Echo had
							incredibly fragile skin and lacked a properly functioning amygdala, the part of the
							brain which is responsible for feelings of fear. Only a months after being created,
							Echo was tragically killed by another newer prototype clone after instigating a fight
							with it. In memory of our first clone, we named our cloning technology Echo.

							Besides just being the first clone, Echo has had an important lasting impact 
							on the direction we have taken. We do extensive checks after a clone is created 
							to ensure they are properly adjusted to their new environment. Though there has never 
							been a clone that has had defects since our technology became public, the checks also 
							involve ensuring that the clone is healthy and ready to live a life.

							The pain of losing Echo still haunts our team to this day. 
							There has never been a lack of mourning for Echo, despite the incident happening so long ago. 
							We strive to be as respectful to all fallen clones, as we believe them to be equal to their 
							original person. While it is a tragedy, we know Echo would want us to keep moving forward, 
							and that is exactly what we did and will keep doing.

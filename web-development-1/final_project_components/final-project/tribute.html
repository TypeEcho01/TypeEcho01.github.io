						The first Echo, which was a clone of the founder Dr. Joe
						Oak, was cloned in 2006, a little over a decade before the opening of this technology
						to the public. At the time, the name of the company was not yet considered, so we
						dubbed this first clone "Echo", since it was an echo of Dr. Oak. Echo was full of life
						and ecstatic to be alive, just as excited as Dr. Oak that it was a success.
						Unfortunately, since this was the first prototype of our technology, Echo had
						incredibly fragile skin and lacked a properly functioning amygdala, the part of the
						brain which is responsible for feelings of fear. Only a month after being created,
						Echo was tragically killed by another newer prototype clone after instigating a fight
						with it. In memory of our first clone, we named our cloning technology Echo.
					</p>

					<p class="purpleBox">
						Besides just being the first clone, Echo has had an important lasting impact 
						on the direction we have taken. We do extensive checks after a clone is created 
						to ensure they are properly adjusted to their new environment. Though there has never 
						been a clone that has had defects since our technology became public, the checks also 
						involve ensuring that the clone is healthy and ready to live a life.
					</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p class="darkPurpleBox">
						The pain of losing Echo still haunts our team to this day. 
						There has never been a lack of mourning for Echo, despite the incident happening so long ago. 
						We strive to be as respectful to all fallen clones, as we believe them to be equal to their 
						original person. While it is a tragedy, we know Echo would want us to keep moving forward, 
						and that is exactly what we did and will keep doing.

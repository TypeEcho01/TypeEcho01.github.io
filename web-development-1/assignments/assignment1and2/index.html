					In her article, "404 Page Not Found," Kate Wagner writes about the impact smartphones had on the internet, 
					ultimately illustrating how they shifted people from the web to apps which caused the decline of online media.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Before apps, websites were easy to make and everyday people could discover sites made by people just like them. 
				    While companies had their own websites, they were on the same playing field as everyone else and certainly did not dominate what people looked at online.
					Now that apps have taken over, companies with infinitely large advertising budgets have their apps noticed almost exclusively over independent apps.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, apps and app stores have let companies get around the freedom websites had.
					Wagner references writer Christopher Mims who claimed that "apps and app stores are all about throttling the competition" (Wagner).
					The apps that are pushed to the top of the featured section in app stores are mostly apps owned by the app store owners.
					For example, Apple pushes their own apps over their biggest competitor, Google, in their app store.
					It's difficult for an independent app to be made, as they are forced to follow these app store's strict guidlines.
					These independent apps also suffer from a lack of advertising budget, making these rarely found by people.
				</p>

				<p>
					On the topic of competition, websites cannot compete with the overwhelming force of apps.
					Wagner cites that "roughly 90 percent of time spent on our phones is devoted to appsâ€”not the web" (Wagner).
					This suprising statistic makes clear the impact phones have had on the decline of the web.
					While computers, which tend to spend more time on the web than phones, are owned by many, they are not as widespread as phones.
					This has exasperated the decline of websites as the most common way to view online media is through a phone.
				</p>

				<p>
					Altough though websites are not used nearly as much as apps, they still have to adapt to phones, the most accessable way to use the internet, or risk being forgotten completely.
					Wagner makes the point that "web design declined from its creative, more variegated heights to become flat, highly minimalistic, and multi-platform" in order to accomidate phones (Wagner).
					Web design, before apps, was much more varied. Because anyone could make a website, they were completely different from site to site.
					Having to accomidate for phones has pushed away this creativety for the sake of something safe and reliable.
					Without phones, it is likely that websites would still be just as varied as they were when the web was made.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, the dominance of apps have led to the dissolution of certain websites.
					Wagner points out that Flash-based sites, were "not supported by the iPhone or Android" (Wagner).
					Flash has been entirely shut down today, likely due to this very fact, leading to countless media using Flash to die out.
					A huge site, Cool Math Games, had to scramble to perserve itself as most of its games were Flash games, and was unfortunely unable to perserve all of its content.
					While it's unclear how many other web tools and sites were shut down due to their inability to be on phones, it is certain that once big names like Flash have been destroyed due to this.
				</p>

				<p>
					In conclusion, smartphones have caused the downfall of websites and the rise of apps, which pushed large companies to become larger,
					competition to be throttled, creativity to be thwarted, and media to be lost.

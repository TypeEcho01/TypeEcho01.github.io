                        The fictitious truth is that cloning is real, and my company can clone people for you! A
                        fictitious truth is something that has a lot of made-up evidence surrounding it so that the
                        concept appears to be true but is actually false. The concept of a fake cloning facility and a
                        company that specializes in this is of interest to me because cloning is a cool and fun
                        concept, and I think I can do a lot with this concept. Cloning could lead to lots of
                        interesting possibilities as well as questions about the morality of it.

                        This project could become a "benevolent untruth" because it would be a funny website to
                        show people. It would be so absurd that no one in their right mind would believe that it is a
                        real thing if you investigated it, but it would look professional enough to look like an official
                        website if you squinted your eyes. It would be like The Onion, a notorious parody fake news
                        website that could look like a real source if you were to glance at it for a second and didn't
                        do research into what The Onion is or what the content is in the news post, or look at the
                        finer details of the content, such as the sources they cite. Overall, it would be a website to
                        bring laughter to people, despite being a lie.

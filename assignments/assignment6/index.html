				<h1>7 Reasons Why Big Dogs Are Nicer Than Small Dogs (2023) - Olivia Johnson</h1>
			</header>

			<p>
				Contrary to their huge size, giant dogs are usually some of the sweetest Fidos you'll ever meet. 
				This is why they have been given the name 'gentle giants.' 
				Some of the breeds that fall into this category include Mastiffs, Leonbergers, Saint Bernards, Newfoundlands, 
				Anatolian Shepherds, Scottish Deerhounds, Great Pyrenees dogs, and Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs.
				<br>
				So, why are big dogs often nicer? First, a big dog's gentle nature might be linked to their original purpose. 
				You might wonder, “What do you mean?” Most giant canines were bred for less harmful activities, 
				which may have contributed to their tender temperament.
				<br>
				On the other hand, most small dogs were bred to hunt and attack. 
				The best examples of this are Dachshunds and Terriers, both of which were used for killing badgers and vermin. 
				Although they are now often bred for a friendlier temperament, this instinct may still reside in some small dogs, 
				making them potentially more aggressive than their gentle giant counterparts.

				While it is true that some big dogs are very sweet, they still have a bigger potential to hurt people, 
				especially children, when compared to small dogs. Their larger size makes them able to 
				step on small children, and their large mouths and teeth make their bites from being provoked 
				by a curious child even more dangerous than a small dog.
				<br>
				In additon, there are plenty of big dogs that were bred for hunting and attacking. 
				These breeds include Mastiffs, Irish Wolfhounds, Great Danes, Rottweilers, 
				Dogo Argentinoa, Alaskan Malamutea, Rhodesian Ridgebacka, Boerboela, Cane Corsoa, Kangala, and Bloodhounds.
				<br>
				Again, although it is true that some small dogs were bred for violence, there are plenty who were not. 
				My small dog, Ollie, is a Shih Tzu, a breed that was bred to be a lap dog. Ollie is a very sweet dog 
				who doesn't bark often and loves to cuddle and play without biting. 
				<br>
				There are also plenty of other small dog breeds who were not bred to be violent.
				Some of these breeds are Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Pug, French Bulldog, Pomeranian, 
				Bichon Frise, Maltese, Havanese, Papillon, Boston Terrier, Italian Greyhound.

							Here at Echo: Cloning Industries, we don't believe in specified times for appointments. 
							Just pick a day and show up whenever! Our doctors will be ready for you. 
							We are an incredibly large organization, so we are confident there will be no wait, 
							and that there will be one of our locations close to you. 
							We are always looking to innovate on what is the status quo and make it better.
						</p>

							When you arrive at your appointment, you can choose to either clone yourself or someone else in your group, 
							or you may choose from one of our many templates! 
							Unfortunately, due to differences in template options between locations, these are only viewable in person. 
							Additionally, the FARCE Regulations (Federal Act Regarding Cloning Ethics) places restrictions on who 
							can and cannot be cloned. You can view more about the FARCE Regulations <a href="research.html">here</a>.

					<div class="purpleBox">
						<p>
							The cost and duration of your appointment depends on how many clones you are ordering. 
							We take time after a clone is complete in order to ensure that they are adjusted to their surroundings. 
							We know the cost can be high, so we offer several discounts and promotions, 
							including senior discounts when ordering any clones over 65 years of age!

							The FARCE Regulations (Federal Act Regarding Cloning Ethics) was passed in
							2010 in order to ensure that we and any other organizations looking to bring
							the incredible world of cloning to reality remain as ethical as possible. The
							FARCE Regulations require us to follow rules about the minimum age a
							person can be cloned. These ages vary state by state, and information
							regarding how old you or someone you'd like to clone must be in your state is
							shown in image the image below. We take this regulation very seriously, so
							please contact us if you have any questions about whether cloning is right for
							you.

							The Science Behind Replicating Cells: Replicating a single cell doesn't sound
							complicated, but it proved to be for scientists around the world until a recent
							breakthrough. We interviewed Dr. Joesph Oak, the head doctor of the
							revolutionary Echo: Cloning Industries, to ask about how such an
							accomplishment was made. "While I can't go into too much detail—trade
							secrets—I can talk about the very basics of how replicating cells work,” Dr.
							Oak explained, "Using a machine which analyzes the gene data of a person,
							we can take that data and store it. Then, we use another machine which
							combines the elements which make up cells to construct the clone.” The
							construction process is extremely quick, as Dr. Oak claimed that "The team
							has spent years, blood, sweat, and tears in order to optimize the process as
							much as possible.” In addition to optimizing the speed, Dr. Oak mentioned,
							"We also took that time to optimize so that we ensure as little genetic data is
							lost as possible. Early prototypes led to clones with some disabilities the
							original person did not have due to genetic data loss.”

							The Psychology of Clones by Dr. Joesph Oak (snippet): Clones' personality,
							regarding how much is shared with their original person, is a strange
							phenomenon. With the expectation of identical genes, one would expect
							personality to be the exact same. Yet, dozens of clones have been recorded
							to display traits that are on the complete opposite end of the spectrum from
							what their original person's personality would suggest. This has even been
							observed in animal clones. I theorize this is due to genetic loss, the concept
							that some genetic data is lost when attempting to recreate an organism's
							cells. While I have remedied much of this loss, I hypothesize that there will
							always be a slight amount of genetic loss. However, I'm unsure if this is
							entirely bad, as even slight differences in personalities between a clone and
							their original person can lead to significantly less tension between each
							other that is bound to happen when interacting with someone who is a
							carbon copy of oneself.

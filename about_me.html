					My name is Echo and I'm a Freshman here at Columbia College Chicago. 
					I major in Programming and I would like to be a game developer. 
					I'm excited to be taking this Web Development class because working with the web is also something I'm interested in learning more about.
					It'd also be useful to make a personal website for myself later when I want to look for serious employment.
					Overall, I'm very glad to be here and learning about all types of programming!
